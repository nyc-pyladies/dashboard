# Global PyLadies Dashboard

This is an infrastructure to explore PyLadies chapters around the world in a data-driven manner that explores trends and provides insights to enhance better decision making for the chapters and PyLadies leadership.

The goal is to make it easier to find chapters, find upcoming events, discover active and inactive groups, track high profile groups based on activity and size, understand the global distribution of groups and bring to light, areas of under-representation.

Primary data source for this work is the API of meetup.com

The Dashboard will be available soon: [https://nyc-pyladies.github.io/pyladies-dashboard/pyladies.html](https://nyc-pyladies.github.io/pyladies-dashboard/pyladies.html)
